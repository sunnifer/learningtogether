// Write a program, Time.java, that reads in one non-negative integer command-line argument that represents the number of minutes that have elapsed since 12:00pm. Create a string whose value is "am" or "pm". The program then outputs a start time of 12:00pm and a finish time of the start time added to the elapsed time.

// divide $N by 60 to get $h (hours)
// getting am or pm:
// find remainder of $h % 24; if its hours 0-11, its pm; if its 12-23, it's am;
// getting the right hour: $h % 12


// create integer $N command-line argument

$N = $argv[1];

// write Start time: 12:00pm and End Time:

echo "Start time: 12:00pm\n";
echo "End time: ";

// divide $N/60 - call the quotient $h;

$h = $N / 60;
settype($h, "int");


// getting the right hour

$hour = $h % 12;

if ($hour == 0) {
  echo 12;
}

else {
  echo $hour;

// getting am / pm

// finding the right minute

$m = $N % 60;

// echo "\n$m"; but add 0 in front of $m if < 10

if ($m < 10) {
  echo ":0" . $m . $ampm . "\n";
